# CV-learned-from-Angela-Yu

I have created this CV using HTML, a widely-used markup language for building websites. By using HTML, I was able to create a clean and visually appealing CV that effectively showcases...

-skills
-experiences  
-accomplishments

With HTML, I was able to incorporate various multimedia elements such as images, videos, and links, making it easy for potential employers and recruiters to learn more about the person and his work. Additionally, this CV is fully responsive, meaning it can be viewed on a variety of devices, including desktops, laptops, tablets, and mobile phones.

I invite you to take a look at this HTML CV that i have learned from Angela Yu.
